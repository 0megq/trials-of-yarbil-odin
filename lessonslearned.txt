- this is manually memory managed language. if there is magic bugs happening out of nowhere it's probably a memory issue
	- addendum: it's not the language. it's you, honey
- you can edit the source code

- don't forget why you're doing the things that you do
- make systems for debugging a feature, then build the feature
- if you feel like refactoring something, then do it. you'll probably feel that urge again and it slows you down
