hello,

here are my solutions for solving the issues with serializing the game data as a whole, not just enemy data

for all objects, create separate types simply for saving and loading data about each entity. create functions to transform
the save/load data into the usable structs. after that, whenever we make changes to the enemy struct, for example, we don't
need to worry about saving and loading, nearly as much. If we need to save and load new data about the enemy then what we do is 
create a new version of the save/load enemy struct. then we create a function for converting the previous save/load enemy struct
to the new version. this has the benefit of being able to convert really old save data into updated formats.
